# Vehicle Noise Synthesizer
 VNS is an open-source free audio addon primarily designed for Unity to simulate vehicle sounds based on engine rpm similar to a granulator.

An Enhanced FM4-Inspired Vehicle Sound Synthesizer

***Can be used for:***

:ballot_box_with_check: Engine

:ballot_box_with_check: Intake

:ballot_box_with_check: Exhausts

:ballot_box_with_check: Transmission¬π

:ballot_box_with_check: Differential¬π (and more!)

:information_source:  This uses real audio clips per Engine RPM and Engine Load to create realistic sound/noise



***Pros:***

:white_check_mark:  Lightweight (Async Calculations - per fixed delta time)

:white_check_mark:  Uses only Unity, Optionally supports Unity Audio Mixer - No FMOD needed

:white_check_mark:  Auto setups audio clips and procedural Audio Source creation make it user-friendly for modding



***Cons:***

:x: Needs separate audio files per RPM¬≤

:x: Does not respect engine piston cycle frequency for fading audio clips *Or in other words, it fades audio clips linearly smoothly which is not "always" good*

üîÅ***How to loop?***

These are useful to compose loop audio for your vehicle sound simulation.
- Here it is described how to seamlessly loop audio using a free audio tool manually:
 - Intermediate Approach:  https://gamedevbeginner.com/create-looping-sound-effects-for-games-for-free-with-audacity/
 - Advanced Approach: https://youtu.be/lMZXjCeAUPM
- This one is even much easier, you don't need to download a tool, and is online but a bit more limited: https://www.drumbot.com/projects/looper/
- This uses paid software to correct the pitch and make a cleaner seamless audio clip: https://youtu.be/1bnasSQbBqk

:warning:***Alternatives?***

Although this asset was done with the idea of using it in [my passion project ATG Simulator](https://ATG-Simulator.com), I would say the paid and Fmod ones might bring cleaner sounds and are easier to work with. 
In fact, the original idea was published as a github repo - which unfortunately I lost its URL - to recreate a Forza Motorsport 4 type of audio simulation for cars. It was before FMod planned to have a free license for indie devs and hobbyists. That's why I took it and significantly re-wrote and enhanced it to support engine load, dynamic pitch and so. Although nowadays  FMod is a paid software that you can use for free, below is a list of assets and plugins that you can use instead of this one for your projects - the prices are valid at the time of writing this text:

 - [FMOD Indie _(Free under some limitations, Needs your audio clips)_](https://www.fmod.com/download)
 - Unity Asset : [**Realistic Engine Sounds** (from 23 US$ to  more than +260 USD)](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/audio/realistic-engine-sounds-2-pro-edition-224783)
 - Unity/Unreal/... Plugin: [**Crankcase Rev** (from 1,500 USD)](https://www.audiokinetic.com/en/products/plugins/crankcase-rev/)
 - DAW Plugin _(Can mix both engine and exhaust sounds of different vehicles)_: [**Igniter** (430 USD)](https://www.krotosaudio.com/igniter/)
 - DAW Plugin _(Recommended for engine sounds only)_: [**Audio Motors**](https://lesound.io/product/audiomotors-pro/)
 - Unity Asset : [**Granular Synthesis for Engine Audio** (Free)](https://github.com/CombatWombatZockchster/Granular-Synthesis-for-Engine-Audio)
 - Unity/Unreal _(Procedural Engine Sounds)_: [**Nemisindo Engine** (44 USD)](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/audio/nemisindo-engine-procedural-sound-effects-222246) 
 - Standalone _(Procedural Realistic Car Sounds, Very CPU intensive)_: [**Engine Simulator** (Free)](https://www.engine-sim.parts/)
 - Android App _(Limited predefined audio files, Basic non-seamless loop)_: [**RevHeadz** (free but w/ in-app purchases)](https://rev-headz.com/)

Note that with DAW or standalone apps and plugins you may record looped audio clips for this or the other assets for simulating your audio in real time within a video game.

:information_source: ***How to use it?***

Either download the unitypackage or a zipped archive of this repo. And import them into a new Unity project. Note that this asset has a pair of demo scenes that need NWH Vehicle Physics and NWH Dynamic Water Physics. To be able to use any of the two demo scenes you will need to import the said assets into your project first, then import this GitHub project. You shall have none of the NWH assets, one of them or all of them to use this asset. Just study the codes which are commented line by line (if they were important for understanding the codes) and delete the scripts that are not related to your project  - e.g. NWH Input demo samples.

:information_source: ***Why the heck am I sharing this freely?***

I think if you help the community you get more quality assets back not only for yourself but for others. So I expect people happily use this but also improve it and share an enhanced version of it with others.

:copyright: Dan. The original script and its idea were inspired by several internet sources and GitHub Repositories like Keijiro Takahashi, CombatWombatZockchster, manueleisl, and others.

Thanks for your attention.

Footnotes:

¬π Transmission and differential sounds from the video are not by this script, Also blow-off and other sounds are not part of this asset as they are not intended to be.

¬≤ This script is also inspired by this video of the Turn10 Audio Engineer: <https://youtu.be/UNvka9GL-9k>. Same as Forza Horizon 3 or Forza Motorsport 7, it needs audio clips based on different rpm speeds. ```E.g Ferrari458Engine_Accelerating_at_the_rpm_speed_of_5000.wav``` and it needs at least one accelerating audio clip though very few and too many clips may result in subpar quality.
